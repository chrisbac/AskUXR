Reporting research

Storytelling is a key part of the research process. It’s important for the insights that come from research to resonate and live beyond your study. Communicating consistently and effectively will increase the impact of your research.


Reporting research: Best practices:

When you reach the reporting stage, your key stakeholders should already be aware of the research and results. This stage is really about documentation and action.
Research deliverables vary, depending upon the study, timeline, and how your team operates. Know the audience for your debrief or report and decide on the best way to present the results of your research. Project managers are an increasingly important audience.
Be sure to communicate early and often with your product teams. Gaining their involvement early on will greatly increase the impact of your research.

Some best practices for reporting research include:
1. Make sure your research is easily understood by stakeholders
2. Using consistent terminology in reporting
3. Use storytelling to gain users interest

Reporting research: Best practices: Make sure your research is easily understood by stakeholders:

It’s important that our stakeholders, which include product teams and executives, can easily find and understand the results of research projects. Research should live beyond the playback for future discovery. Write as if your audience is not familiar with the subject area and provide enough context that they don’t get lost in details and acronyms.
Reporting research outcomes with consistent structure and terms increases the likelihood of it being incorporated into product roadmaps, increasing the impact of your research.

Reporting research: Best practices: Using consistent terminology in reporting:

Aligning around a common terminology is critical for tracking research impact at scale. It helps stakeholders understand key information within your report, and across other research studies.
When reporting what your discovered in your research study, be sure that you are referring to the following terms consistently.

Best practices: Using consistent terminology in reporting: Findings (The “what”):
Findings are prepared data that has been processed, aggregated and organized into a more human-friendly format that provides more context. They do not include assumptions or opinions, only what was discovered or the sentiment of the users.

Best practices: Using consistent terminology in reporting: Insights (The “why” behind the “what”):
A pattern, relationship or connection in the data in the context of the user that can have an impact or lead to an outcome. Insights are generated by analyzing information and drawing conclusions. Both data and findings set the stage for the discovery of insights that can then influence decisions and drive change. One or more findings can support an insight or multiple insights. Many, but not all, insights will be actionable and may lead to recommendations. An insight that drives action is typically more valuable than one that simply answers a question — especially an insight that makes you rethink something and pushes you in a new direction. 

Best practices: Using consistent terminology in reporting: Recommendations (The “what’s next” or what to do with the insight):
What to do with actionable insights gleaned from the findings written in the form of a recommendation to help your team understand how to progress this information. Use outcomes-based language as you write these. There may not always be a recommendation depending on the type of research being conducted, or at early stages of research. You may need to conduct multiple studies to arrive at recommendations.

Reporting research: Best practices: Use storytelling to gain users interest:
Whether for your report or playback, structure the research in a storytelling approach that speaks to the business goals.

- Begin with questions to capture audience’s attention and keep them engaged in the story that you are going to tell them.
- Instead of offering a long list of facts and figures, create a coherent story that connects your findings, insights and speaks to the business goals.
- Prioritize your insights by the importance of how they impact business goals.
- End with recommendations to drive next steps after research.

When possible, use visualization to support your data reporting. You can find the IBM Design Language data visualization in the resources below.

- Sort bar charts from largest to smallest (or vice versa) to make it easy to consume.
- Ensure the color coding and charts match the data scale. For example, use a range of colors rather than shades of a single color (ordinal scale) for a nominal data set like agree/disagree 5-point scale.

Reporting research: Sharing your research: 

A best practice to help increase the impact of your research is to have a point of view and structure your report around your insights and recommendations. Starting with an informed conclusion will make a discussion more productive, and be helpful for those who did not attend.
To ensure the most important information from your research is easily discoverable, you should include an executive summary up front. Summarizing at a high level is important, try to distill the most important insights and/or recommendations that you want your audience to take away.

Reporting research: Sharing your research: Research summary

1. Overview: Briefly summarize in a few sentences: 
- The goal (what research question being answered)
- Why it was done (motivation / business need / why it matters)
- Details (method, data source, # participants)
2. Objectives: Key goals of the study, tied to business objectives.
3. Key takeaways: Highlight the most important findings and insights from results. 
4. Recommendations and next steps: One to two sentences on what has been done / is being done / will be done as a result of this work. Use outcomes based language as you write these.

You can find a template and example of a nicely designed executive summary in the Templates section below.

Reporting research: Sharing your research: Research report

Most researchers create a more detailed artifact, which we will refer to as a report for this guidance. The format may vary by team, researcher, and type of research project. Research reports can, and should when possible, be accompanied by data visualization, user quotes and videos, diagrams, personas, journey maps and other artifacts depending on the type of study and what is relevant to the audience.

Regardless of the type of report output, use the summary outline, above, and then go into more details in a full report.

Common elements in a research report include:
1. Research Objectives
2. Findings and insights
3. Recommendations
4. Next steps
5. Appendix


1. Objectives: Here you can go into more detail around the study objective and why you decided on a particicular project, methods,and goals.

- Goal of the research study — why was this research conducted, what research question were you trying to answer?
- Business rational — why is the research important for IBM?
- Research method — why was the research conducted this specific way?

2. Findings and insights: Communicate findings and insights supported by evidence.
Provide quantitative data and present the data in an engaging format to make it more appealing and easy to understand.
Seeing is believing. Include quotes, video clips, stories, and other examples from your research participants to further demonstrate the insights.
What are the major patterns or themes that emerged from the research?
What does it mean in context of the user?

3. Recommendations: Research should help to drive action and lead to outcomes. Ensure that, if applicable, you write recommendations based on the insights you’ve gained in your study. These may evolve with input from your product teams or additional research, but always have a point of view as a starting place.
What do implications do these insights have on our Hill or deliverable in terms of outcomes?
What can be done to further explore the insights?

4. Next steps: Include next steps for the team to follow up on based on the insights and recommendations you’ve gained in your study. 
- How will the recommendations be prioritized?
- Is more research planned?
- Do you need sponsorship for further research on the topic?
- Are there key decision makers that need to see this information to move forward?

5. Appendix
Include the researchers, sponsors, research methods, participants, and any other information that might be useful but not listed in the summary.

Reporting research: Sharing your research: Tips for reporting quantitative results
- Round numbers instead of using decimals, e.g. 35% instead of 35.43%. Avoid making bold statements based on small sample size.
- When possible, use visualization to support your data reporting. You can find the IBM Design Language data visualization in the resources below.
- Sort bar charts from largest to smallest (or vice versa) to make it easy to consume.
- Ensure the color coding and charts match the data scale. For example, use a range of colors rather than shades of a single color (ordinal scale) for a nominal data set like agree/disagree 5-point scale.

Reporting research: Playing back and socializing:
Craft a story with a meaningful plot, detailed visualizations, and attention to your audience. Create a sense of urgency for your work, and bring your user to life.
Many teams host a formal playback for the product team and executive(s). None of the information in a playback should be new to the product team as communication should be ongoing. Product teams should be aware of research as it is being planned and conducted.

Playing back and socializing: Post-playback activities:
After the playback, it’s a good practice to send a follow-up email (or Slack message) to your stakeholders, with links to the artifacts and key highlights in the body of the email. This allows your stakeholders to still understand the important takeaways from the research without having to open the report, and gives them easy-to-share highlights. Lastly, remember to go back to your research plan and add all links to your final deliverables.

Playing back and socializing: Other activities to share your research:
- Share your playback recording: If you recorded your playback with Webex, you will receive an email with a link to your recording. Forward this to any invited stakeholders who could not attend your playback, and download the video to the Box folder with your project deliverables.
- Post highlights to Slack: Think about the channels your audience visits as opportunities to share your work. A team or product-specific channel might be appropriate. The #user-research-study-results Slack channel is a great way to share your findings with other researchers. This channel is open for all UX research sharing. Check the pinned posts for recommendations and guidance on formatting your post.

Playing back and socializing: Pointers for ensuring your research lives beyond the playback:
- Write to share with a broader IBM audience who might not know the nuances of your space
- Ensure acronyms are spelled out in the first usage with the acronym in parenthesis, e.g. Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D)
- Remove or clarify niche and jargon terms in plain language (including project code names)
- Only include content appropriate for IBM-wide consumption
- Include additional links to relevant materials, but make sure they are also appropriate for IBM-wide consumption

Playing back and socializing: Publishing your research internally:

Share your research in your team’s research repository
Most teams have a form of research repository which allows you to make your research available to a broader audience. Software, Cloud and parts of Infrastructure use the User Insights Hub research library as the primary repository for their teams.
If you are sharing research artifacts stored within Box or Mural, be sure permissions are set to allow users to view. Whenever possible link to a single artifact, not a folder or Mural that leaves people searching for where to start.
If using the User Insights Hub from your team base, you will be directed to add project findings, insights and recommendations to the Global Repository. The “Complete” status triggers a workflow that will publish your research in the User Insight Hub within a few days.

Playing back and socializing: Research integrity

As someone who conducts or participates in design research, your role is to report the truth through honesty and transparency. Without integrity, the discipline of research falls apart. Misrepresentation of research findings will cause people to distrust not only your work, but also the practice of research as a whole. 
- Stick to verified research methods
- Do not present data in a biased way
- Be transparent with limitations in recruiting, data collection strategies, confidence, etc.
