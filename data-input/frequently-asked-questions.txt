UX Research Support and FAQs

Recruiting Participants: Incentives
Can I give BluePoints to IBMers who participate in my study? 	Yes, pending budget approval to do so. Bluepoints are not available to contractors or interns.


Recruiting Participants: Incentives
Can we send incentives from Tremendous to our User Interview panelists? 	No, we are no longer using Tremendous. Find direction on providing incentives in User Interviews here. https://pages.github.ibm.com/reops/ux-research/ux-research-tools/user-interviews


Recruiting Participants: Research agreements
Can I use the User Engagement Agreement (UEA) for things other than user research?	No, the UEA is specifically for conducting user experience research activities. The UEA should not be used for any advisory boards/councils (e.g., Z Design Council), this will require an FPA and an A/V consent form if there's expectation to record the engagement.


Recruiting Participants: Research agreements
Can I use the User Research Event Participation Agreement (UREPA) or the User Research Participation Agreement (URPA)?	These agreements have been replaced by the User Engagement Agreement (UEA). Please discontinue use of these agreements.


Recruiting Participants: Research agreements
How can I send the User Engagement Agreement (UEA) in the User Engagement Hub (UEH)?	"If using client list, you can directly send the UEA in the User Engagement Hub.
Start by signing-up the user if they are not already in the Hub.
Then, go to ""My Prospects"" on the right hand side, under your profile.
Select the participant(s) you want to record for the upcoming study.
A blue bar will appear where you will be able to select ""Send UEA"", and an email will automatically be sent to the participant to review and accept."


Recruiting Participants: Research agreements
How should I handle sharing sensitive information in a communication?	Never send non-GA information in an email or newsletter. If presenting this information, be sure all viewers have signed an NDA.


Recruiting Participants: Research agreements
What does the User Engagement Agreement (UEA) cover?	"The UEA covers a research study. Some studies can last longer that a single interaction with your participant. As long as the research study is one of the same focus, goal, product, etc. then the participant will not need to sign another UEA until that changes. 
Under this agreement, participants may share information about their experience and agree to not share confidential information about their company. IBM may share confidential information that users agree not to share for 5 years."


Recruiting Participants: Research agreements
What should I know about the Feedback Program Agreement (FPA)?	The Feedback Program Agreement (FPA) is a company-level agreement that allows IBM to dive deep into question's about the user's company. It can be sent out and tracked through the User Engagement Hub. The FPA is good in perpetuity, meaning that as long as it has been signed by someone with signing authority in the client company it is valid. Anyone with signing authority in the company should sign it (e.g., VP). It does not include consent to record audio and visual. This can only be granted by the individual. Please use the A/V consent form. This agreement covers beta programs unless we are asking users to access new, unreleased software or cloud environment - this would call for a new early agreement to be introduced and signed.


Recruiting Participants: General
What options are available for recruiting participants for UX research studies? For recruiting current IBM customers as participants, use the UEH (User Engagement Hub). For recruiting non-IBM customers, use Respondent.io or User Interviews. For Recruiting IBMers as research participants, contact them though internal channels such as email and Slack. If these options to recruit for your study aren't working well enough to fill the number of participants needed, there is an option to use an alternative vendor service for recruitment. The current recommended tools for specialized, niche recruitment is GLG, Sago (formerly Schlesinger), and Applause. These will require extra approval so consult your manager.


Recruiting Participants: General
Can I recruit employees of competitors to be a research participant? Is there a protocol? 	Yes. Make it clear that you're from IBM, use your IBM email address, and remind them before showing anything proprietary that they've signed an NDA.


Recruiting Participants: General
Can we publish the same screener on multiple platforms?	This is encouraged, and precisely why two different platforms are available! Researchers commonly try to collect 50% of their desired total participants from each tool, but please keep in mind a panelist may receive two invitations to your study if they are on both platforms.
Does Research Operations handle recruitment for researchers?	No, our model is self-service. Check out our page about recruitment for more information.

Research Tools: User Insights Hub (UIH)
How do I fix broken Box links in User Insights Hub?	When you’re adding Box links to User Insights Hub, make sure they are set to “anyone in the company”! Otherwise other IBMers won’t be able to see your materials.

Research Tools: User Insights Hub (UIH)
For security reasons, Box expires permissions on a rolling basis. If you find a broken Box link in User Insights Hub, reach out to the researchers listed on the project and let them know so they can fix it!


Research Tools: User Insights Hub (UIH)
What are research highlights? 	Highlights are a standalone unit of research content. There are 3 types of highlights — findings, insights and recommendations. Findings are a set of facts, patterns in the data, or summaries across it. Insights are the reason or correlation behind the findings, why you think they occurred. Recommendations are what to do with actionable insights, focusing on specific outcomes for the users. Research highlights are a new format being used within IBM Software.


Research Tools: User Insights Hub (UIH)
What is the process for entering content into the User Insights Hub?	Software teams have been onboarded to the Insights Hub, with other teams being added. If you are unsure if your team uses the UIH, ask in #ibm-user-insights-hub. Check out the most recent guidance for content in the UIH here https://airtable.com/appxhEfPfsvo3wH7E/pagiyBzDcoDBeo4Kl?aGT5A=recJnGpMwELQJssgT&UCEBA=reczPFzwuFFbMxMOy

Research Tools: AskUXR
Can I use AskUXR to generate research artifacts for me?	AskUXR was designed for answering questions about UXR at IBM. Assistance on UX Research work such as generating research artifacts (parameter-based personas, journeys, etc) is not supported. Specific tools are being planned for that purpose in the near future.


Research Tools: AskUXR
Does AskUXR have similar capabilities to ChatGPT?	No, AskUXR is not a fluid conversation bot, even though sometimes it gives the opposite impression. It's just a Q&A tools,  and it doesn't have memory, so if you ask it to recover an information that was provided in the beginning of the session it won't know.


Research Tools: AskUXR
What is AskUXR?	AskUX is an experimental Q&A tool, designed to help IBMers find UXR-related information in a faster and better way. It's officially based on the UX Research Playbook (https://pages.github.ibm.com/reops/ux-research/research-practice-playbook/overview) although it covers parts of the UXR website for a better experience.


Research Tools: AskUXR
How can I provide feedback to improve AskUXR?	To provide a general feedback about AskUXR, please use this form at https://airtable.com/appButViLQv4vGjfz/pagpZYRk06tX9otLV/form. To provide feedback about specific answers the tool is providing, please use the 👍👎 icons below each answer.


Research Tools: AskUXR
How is the AskUXR user feedback stored and used to improve the tool?	AskUXR collects the 👍 👎 feedback anonymously provided by users to improve its answer in the following way: 1) The user provides a "score" using the thumbs up or thumbs down icon, plus some additional information (optional). 2) This information is sent to an Airtable, with the following fields: User Question, User score, Bot Response, Time/date created, Prompt used (to generate the model response). 3) The AskUXR team manually reviews the feedback and manually improves the content on the UXR Playbook or the model prompt if needed. No AI training or fine tuning is performed, and the responses remains anonymous, unless the user voluntarily adds any PII in case they want to be contacted for follow up.


AI and UX Research
How to use AI in research analysis + synthesis?	This is a big topic full of possibilities and risks. Check the work of the GenAi for UXR team for guidance (and roadmap) on the #genai-for-uxr slack channel and  the GenAI for UXR guidelines (work in progress) at  https://app.mural.co/t/uxresearch0879/m/uxresearch0879/1695421608564/abefba6613a14097543007b76e1b50fb4928fa60?sender=u5c6913b680030b988e8f1277


AI and UX Research
Can I use the new AI features within 3rd party UXR tools such as UzerZoom, Airtable, etc?	At the moment, the short answer is no. In July 2023 the IBM CIO (Chief Information Office) released the Employee Guidance - ChatGPT and Similar Third Party Generative Ai Tools. It states that ""IBMers may not use third party generative AI tools for IBM business or with IBM or client data"". As a rule of thumb, ""always assume that sharing data with these third party tools is akin to publicly disclosing that information."".
There is an exception if you are a UX researcher in IBM Consulting and the client asks IBM to use a 3rd party GenAI tool. In this case, ""the terms between IBM and the client must be clear that the client is responsible for procuring the tool and the client assumes all responsibility for the tool’s output"".
The document is available at https://pages.github.ibm.com/ciso-psg/main/supplemental/GenAI.html and we highly encourage you to read it.


AI and UX Research
