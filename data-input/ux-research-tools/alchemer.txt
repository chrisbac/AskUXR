Alchemer best practices: 
Track your projects, organize your surveys, and utilize account libraries.


Track your projects: Once a project is complete (e.g., analysis, follow-up, reporting, etc.) it is recommended that you download:
- A copy of the survey itself
- The survey legend (includes logic, reporting values, and validation information)
- A CSV of the raw data
- Any reports generated by Alchemer
- Any campaign contacts (distribution lists) used, along with their status


Organize your surveys:
- Folders are available on your homepage to help keep your projects organized. Please note that teams and folders are distinctly separate things. Make sure to move your surveys into the appropriate folder to stay organized.
- You are encouraged to create subfolders as needed for your project groups.
- Note that all users will see every folder name, but users will not see a survey unless they are a member of the team to which it’s assigned. Folder and team assignments are not related to each other.


Utilize account libraries:
- Question Library: This can be used to store and reuse single or groups of questions, pages, and text/media elements. If you work on surveys and think there are batteries of questions that might be useful in other IBM projects, please load those questions the Question Library. More information can be found here.
- File Library: Logos, images, spreadsheets, PDF’s and text documents can be uploaded and stored into the Alchemer File Library. Please note these files will be accessible by all of IBMers within the Alchemer account. These files can be embedded into surveys and themes as needed. More information can be found here.
- Theme Library: Saved themes can be applied to your surveys to change the look and feel of the survey experience. Note:this library is not available to any user on the basic license.
- Report Theme Library: Like survey themes, report themes can be saved to the Report Theme Library to quickly brand and stylize your Alchemer reports. Note: this library is not available to any user on the basic license.
Don’t forget to add the time you spend learning any tool to your Think40 hours.
