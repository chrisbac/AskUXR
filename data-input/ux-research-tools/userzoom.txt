UserZoom
UserZoom is a user testing and feedback platform that allows researchers and designers to remotely conduct usability studies in a self-served manner and within hours. 
UserZoom offers our team the powerful ability to complete end-to-end evaluative research without leaving the platform. Our researchers can recruit participants, create usability tests, obtain videos of participants viewing our products, receive structured and unstructured data, and complete analysis on the platform. UserZoom capabilities include moderated and unmoderated remote tests; information architecture research; on-page feedback and surveys; and other studies such as card sorting, tree tests and intent testing.

Remote unmoderated research with UserZoom:
Basic usability testing: capture live video feedback quickly and easily.
Surveys: gather rich, attitudinal feedback using advanced logic, conditions and randomization at scale.
Card sorts: conduct open or closed sorting to ensure your content is structured in a way which your users understand.
Click tests: see where participants click first. Measure their first impressions, define success areas, and visualize clicks by creating a heatmap.
Tree tests: assess the findability of items in your menu by measuring where users expect to locate specific information.
Live intercept: understand the true intent of your visitors and gather feedback on a live website or application.
Advanced UX research: utilize multiple research methods at once. Combine different types of tasks and apply sophisticated logic, conditions, randomization, and more at the same time.
